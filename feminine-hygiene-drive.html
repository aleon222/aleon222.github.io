<p>The visionary spark of our founder, Cerissa A. Brown, gave life to the MLK Day of Service Feminine Hygiene Drive in 2021. This drive addresses a commonly overlooked yet pivotal need: the acute demand for feminine hygiene products, especially among the financially constrained and women experiencing homelessness. In its first year, what started as a humble initiative quickly became a significant movement, securing robust sponsorships from renowned brands, most notably the Honeypot Company.</p>
<p>This drive isn't just an event on Reecee's Reach's calendar; it embodies our unwavering commitment to the Birmingham community. With products donated reaching diverse corners - charities, shelters, mutual aid organizations, and community members facing hardships - our impact reverberates deeply. And it's the tireless volunteers who amplify this effect, ensuring a smooth collection, meticulous sorting, and distribution process.</p>
<P>The persistent support from Birmingham's residents is a testament to its growth and resonance with the community. With each passing year, they turn up in increasing numbers to donate, volunteer, and champion the cause. This heartfelt community movement, orchestrated entirely by volunteers, is more than just a drive. Their fervor and dedication epitomize the drive's essence.</P>
<p>The drive offers more than tangible products. It serves as a beacon for mental health awareness and advocacy. We challenge stigmas tied to mental health, addiction, and homelessness through it. Embedding mental health education within this initiative, we cast a wider net of support and healing.</p>
<p>2023 became a milestone. With over 5,000 individual feminine hygiene products and donations exceeding $6,000, our efforts solidified into tangible impact. Cerissa A. Brown reflects, "The exponential growth and the support of major sponsors like the Honeypot Company is a testament to the community's faith and commitment to our cause."</p>
<p>Martin Luther King Jr. Day stands as a day of proactive service. It's a tribute to community resilience, unity, and crafting collective solutions. Cerissa's words encapsulate the sentiment best: <i>"Every bit counts. Let's actualize Dr. King's vision of a 'Beloved Community' and leave an indelible mark this MLK Day."</i></p>

<h3>Join us in this journey of compassion and change, one package at a time.</h3>
